# Purpose
Complete a small project to help assess skill, experience, ingenuity, problem-solving, and knowledge.

# Scope
Develop a RESTful API that would allow a web or mobile front-end to:

- Create a contact record
- Retrieve a contact record
- Update a contact record
- Delete a contact record
- Search for a record by email or phone number
- Retrieve all records from the same state or city

# Specification
The contact record should represent the following information: 

- name
- company
- profile image
- email
- birth date
- phone number (work, personal)
- address

Provide a unit test for at least one of the endpoints you create.
Feel free to make whatever assumptions you need to about required fields, data formats, and validations; document whatever assumptions you make.
The data can be persisted in whatever persistence layer that you want.
Add documentation with a description of what you did and instructions on how to run and test your solution. Also provide documentation on your API endpoints with sample test data. It could be in a README.md or using whatever tool you consider to be appropriate.
The solution should be ready to deploy on a public cloud platform such as AWS or Azure but you are not required to host it for this exam.

# General Notes
Please, once completed, send it back to your K+C recruiter as a zip file containing all the code and possible documentation. Please make sure to not include unnecessary files such as the Git repository, compiled binaries, etc; We ask that you please submit your project at your earliest convenience (within 24-48 hours).
If you’re applying for a position with a specific language skill, use the specified language. For example: “.NET Engineer” applicants should use .NET to solve this problem. If not specified, use the language of your choice.
